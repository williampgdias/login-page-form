# Sign-up form

I took this project from the [frontend-mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home). 
<br>
<br>
I used form validation using javascript and grid with CSS.
The user can only access if it fills in all the fields correctly. If does not fill any field, a error icon :heavy_exclamation_mark: appear and disappear only if it fills correctly.
